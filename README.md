# Polykatoikia advisor

This thesis presents an experimental approach that enables architects to automatically generate and rank multiple building layouts based on specific metrics, focusing on the Polykatoikia—the prevalent multi-story residential building type in Greece.

By applying graph theory, architectural spaces are conceptualized as nodes, and their relationships—such as adjacency—are represented as edges. The graph offers a flexible and computationally efficient means of analyzing complex architectural layouts. Each layout permutation is evaluated using metrics like construction time, daylight, and other relevant factors.

The developed tool assists architects in rapidly gaining a comprehensive understanding of potential layouts by incorporating critical parameters such as daylight into the early stages of design. This integration enhances decision-making in the design process, leading to more informed and efficient architectural solutions.
